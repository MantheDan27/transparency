# 2026-03-07 - ARP Scanning Bottleneck

**Learning:** Resolving MAC addresses via individual shell commands (`arp -a <ip>`) per IP during network scans creates a massive process-spawning bottleneck, significantly slowing down the scan and consuming excess system resources.
**Action:** Fetch and cache the entire ARP table once per scan batch, looking up individual IPs from the in-memory Map.
