## 2024-05-24 - Implicit Form Labels in Vanilla HTML/JS

**Learning:** When dealing with standard HTML/JS implementations without React or framework JSX, raw `<label>` elements frequently lack the explicit `for` attribute and instead rely on visual proximity to their input fields. Screen readers and automated accessibility tools cannot properly associate the input without this `for` attribute referencing the target `id`.

**Action:** Always manually audit and inject `for="targetId"` into `<label>` elements linked to inputs, avoiding linking labels to non-labelable elements like `<div>` buttons, to ensure strict compliance with Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) and full screen reader operability.
## 2024-04-05 - Accessibility in Implicitly Labeled Forms
**Learning:** In vanilla JS apps, form structures often use generic `<div>` tags mapped with CSS classes (like `.setting-label`) alongside `aria-label` attributes to visually label form inputs without explicitly associating them via a `<label for="...">` element. While `aria-label` makes the input accessible to screen readers, missing an explicit `<label for="[id]">` prevents users from clicking the text label to focus the input, negatively impacting usability for mouse or touch users.
**Action:** Always ensure `<label>` tags explicitly declare the `for` attribute (linked to their target `<input>` ID) to support screen-reader functionality and increase the interactive clickable area for users.
